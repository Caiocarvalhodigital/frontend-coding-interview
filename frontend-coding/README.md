# Production Improvements

## Authentication

- This application is using local storage to handle authentication. In a production ready app, we should use a real authentication method (e.g., AWS Cognito, NextAuth.js or JWT).
- With a real authentication method, we could protect the API route to prevent unauthorized access.

## Database

- Liked photos and "user information" are being stored in localStorage. Instead, we should implement a database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Implement an ORM (e.g., Prisma) to simplify database access.
- Right now, the stored liked photos are not user-specific. With a database, we could use an "user ID" to improve personalization.

## Login Security

- The login request should be protected by rate limiting and captchas to avoid bots and malicious users.
- We could implement an form validation to check if user inputs are formatted correctly.
- We should use password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for secure storage of credentials in a backend.

## Performance & UX

- We could implement photo pagination to avoid slow loading times and improve usability for the user.
- This application currently uses console.error for error handling. In a production environment, we should display visual feedback (e.g., toast notifications or error banners) to inform users when an error occurs.
- This application is entirely client-side rendered and does not currently utilize Server-Side Rendering (SSR). However, we could enhance the user experience by introducing a server component on the Photos page to prefetch data on the server. This would reduce loading times and make the app more SEO-friendly.
